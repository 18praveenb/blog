## 2025
- [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33]{.s10} (Game of the Year)
- [Hollow Knight: Silksong]{.s9} (GOTY runner-up)
- [Cuphead]{.s9} (GOTY honorable mention)
- [Donkey Kong Bananza]{.s9}
- [Hollow Knight]{.s9}
  - The first time I played this game, I gave up shortly after Greenpath and scored it a 6/10. I had been hoping for a boss rush and was stuck backtracking from benches, dying, and losing my Geo.
  - When I came back to play Hollow Knight in preparation for Silksong, I was ready for the exploration, and my biggest concern was that the world would feel too lifeless. Thankfully, there are quite a few NPCs you can run into and chat with during your journey, and I had a much better time (though once I got far enough along in my Silksong playthrough, it was hard to go back to Hollow Knight bosses and deal with the less forgiving dash and heal mechanisms).
